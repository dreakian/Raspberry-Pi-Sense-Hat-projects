# Raspberry-Pi-Sense-Hat-projects

The files included in this repository were projects that I did while playing around with a Raspberry Pi board that I have at home. 

The projects mostly feature the LED matrix displaying text, simulating animation or the depiction of miscellaneous shapes. 

It should be noted that I wrote these projects via the Thonny IDE while using the VNC application to remotely connect to the server with which the board is connected to. 

For that reason, there may be some issues with formatting (indentation) because I had to manually retype the code for the projects. 

Ideally, I will include videos that demonstrate how the code works.

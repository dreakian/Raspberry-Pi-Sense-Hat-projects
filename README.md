# Raspberry-Pi-Sense-Hat-projects

The files included in this repository were projects that I did while playing around with a Raspberry Pi board that I have at home. 

The projects mostly feature the LED matrix displaying text, simulating animation or the depiction of miscellaneous shapes. 

One project, "data_collection_test.py", is an exception. It will collect temperature, humidity and pressure data and then log that information into a .csv file. I plan to add functionality so that clear timestamps are included for each data entry for the .csv file. This project can be furthered developed and explored by using Jupyter Notebook or an IDE to export the .csv file into a dataframe using Pandas and then engaging in Data Analytics using additional libraries such as PyPlot, Seaborn, Matplotlib and even Scikit-learn for possible temperature/humidity/pressure prediction.

It should be noted that I wrote these projects via the Thonny IDE while using the VNC application to remotely connect to the server with which the board is connected to. 

For that reason, there may be some issues with formatting (indentation) because I had to manually retype the code for the projects. 

Ideally, I will include videos that demonstrate how the code works.
